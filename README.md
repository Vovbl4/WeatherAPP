A simple WPF.NET desktop app for windows that shows the weather

Before accessing the app there is a LogIn/Register form

All the data is stored in a local DB, i used MAMP, if you want to try connect your DB in AppDbContext.cs

in the app there are 4 sections:
  -Main (temperature in a city)
  -Notes (can save and import a .txt file)
  -Account (change login/email for your current account)
  -People (manage existing accounts)
